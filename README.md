We are making a website for human safety.
This website is called People for People since people are standing for people.
Everyone can use this website redardless of age and gender.
By registering into it you can become a hope for someone in danger and someone else can be your hope when you are in danger.
We made a backend using python to get the registration information and to get distress calls.
The registration information includes name, phone number,gender,age,location and guardian number.
All these data is stored into a google sheet with the help of an API gspread.
The frontend is created to show the logo page , registration page and a page to sent distress calls. 
In registration page the user can enter all the personal details.
If he/she completes the registration successfully and the data is stored safely in the googlesheet- "USER DATA", a message will be shown.
In the distress call page you can press on a button to sent distress calls. If the distress call is made sucessfully a message will be sent to the user.
The whole frontend  is made using HTML and CSS.
The code was been ran in virtual studio and the website has been seen
